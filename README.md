# Paper-Summarizer
This repository contains summaries of academic papers related to various fields such as computer science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, neuroscience, psychology, and more.

## Motivation
The goal of this repository is to make it easier for researchers, students, and enthusiasts to quickly understand the key insights, contributions, and findings of a given paper without having to read the entire document. It is also a great resource for individuals who want to stay up-to-date with the latest research in their field of interest.

## Usage
Each paper summary is located in a separate directory, labeled with the name of the paper. Within each directory, you will find a markdown file named "summary.md" that provides a brief overview of the paper's content, methodology, and conclusions. The summaries are written in a concise and clear manner, making it easy to understand the main points of the paper.
